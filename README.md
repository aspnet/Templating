## Getting Started
ASP.NET Templates provide project templates which are used in .NET Core for creating ASP.NET Core applications.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.

## Building Templates
- Running build.cmd in this repo requires NPM which can be installed from https://nodejs.org/en/.
- The ASP.NET localhost development certificate must also be installed and trusted or else you'll get a test error "Certificate error: Navigation blocked".
